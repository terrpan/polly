# ADR-010: Container Service Registry Pattern

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The original dependency injection container in `internal/app/container.go` had several maintainability issues:

1. **Complex Initialization**: Adding a new service required modifications in multiple places across the codebase
2. **Verbose Wiring**: Manual initialization of each service with repetitive patterns
3. **Poor Encapsulation**: Many internal dependencies were exported when they should be private
4. **Inconsistent Access**: Mix of direct field access and method calls for container dependencies
5. **Function Length Issues**: The initialization logic exceeded linting limits due to repetitive code

### Previous Pattern Issues
```go
// Adding a new service required:
// 1. Adding field to Container struct
// 2. Adding initialization in initServices()
// 3. Adding to NewContainer() call chain
// 4. Updating all dependent handlers/tests
```

The original approach violated the DRY principle and made service addition error-prone.

## Decision
We have implemented a **Service Registry Pattern** for the dependency injection container with the following improvements:

### 1. Service Registry Pattern
- Centralized service registration in `createServiceRegistrations()`
- Each service defined as a `serviceRegistration` with name and initialization function
- Clear dependency order management through registration sequence

### 2. Improved Encapsulation
- Made all internal dependencies private (lowercase field names)
- Only export handlers needed by external components (`WebhookRouter`, `HealthHandler`)
- Provide `Logger()` getter method for controlled access to logger

### 3. Simplified Service Addition
Adding a new service now requires only:
```go
{
    name: "NewAwesomeService",
    init: func(c *Container) error {
        c.awesomeService = services.NewAwesomeService(
            c.gitHubClient,
            c.logger,
            c.getTelemetryHelper("polly/awesome"),
        )
        return nil
    },
}
```

### 4. Type Safety Preservation
- All services remain concrete types (no `interface{}`)
- Compile-time type checking maintained
- No runtime type assertions required

## Implementation Details

### Container Structure
```go
type Container struct {
    logger *slog.Logger

    // Storage
    store        storage.Store
    stateService *services.StateService

    // Clients
    gitHubClient *clients.GitHubClient
    opaClient    *clients.OPAClient

    // Services (all private)
    commentService     *services.CommentService
    healthService      *services.HealthService
    checkService       *services.CheckService
    policyService      *services.PolicyService
    policyCacheService *services.PolicyCacheService
    securityService    *services.SecurityService

    // Handlers - only these are exported
    WebhookRouter *handlers.WebhookRouter
    HealthHandler *handlers.HealthHandler

    // Telemetry helpers cache
    telemetryHelpers map[string]*telemetry.TelemetryHelper
}
```

### Service Registry Implementation
```go
func (c *Container) createServiceRegistrations() []serviceRegistration {
    return []serviceRegistration{
        // Service definitions with clear dependencies
    }
}

func (c *Container) initServices() error {
    registrations := c.createServiceRegistrations()
    for _, registration := range registrations {
        c.logger.Info("Initializing service", "name", registration.name)
        if err := registration.init(c); err != nil {
            return fmt.Errorf("failed to initialize %s: %w", registration.name, err)
        }
    }
    c.logger.Info("Services initialized successfully")
    return nil
}
```

### Function Length Exception
The `createServiceRegistrations()` function is allowed to exceed the 80-line limit because:
- It's pure configuration, not complex business logic
- Breaking it down would hurt readability and maintainability
- The service registry pattern requires this centralized definition
- Added specific linter exception: `Function.*createServiceRegistrations.*is too long`

## Consequences

### Positive
1. **Easy Service Addition**: Adding services requires minimal boilerplate
2. **Better Encapsulation**: Clear public/private API boundaries
3. **Type Safety**: Maintained compile-time type checking
4. **Clear Dependencies**: Service initialization order is explicit
5. **Reduced Duplication**: Common initialization patterns centralized
6. **Better Testing**: Cleaner dependency injection for tests

### Negative
1. **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand the registry pattern
2. **Function Length**: One configuration function exceeds style guidelines (accepted trade-off)

### Migration Impact
- **Tests**: Updated to use private fields and `Logger()` method
- **Server**: Updated to use `Logger()` method instead of direct field access
- **Main**: Updated logger access pattern in `cmd/server/main.go`

## Compliance with Project Guidelines

This implementation follows the project's coding instructions:

1. **Type Safety Philosophy**: "Prioritize Type Safety" - All dependencies remain concrete types
2. **Constructor Pattern**: Maintains `NewXxxService` pattern throughout
3. **Dependency Injection**: Clear dependency graph with proper initialization order
4. **Code Reuse**: DRY principle applied to service initialization
5. **Minimal Implementation**: <100 lines of new orchestration code achieved
