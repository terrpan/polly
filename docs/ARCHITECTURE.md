# Polly - System Architecture

## Overview
Polly is a GitHub App that validates pull requests against Open Policy Agent (OPA) policies. It receives GitHub webhooks, evaluates configurable policies, and reports results via GitHub check runs.

## System Architecture

### High-Level Flow
```
GitHub PR/CheckRun Event â†’ Webhook Handler â†’ Policy Service â†’ OPA Evaluation â†’ Check Run Update â†’ GitHub
```

### Component Architecture

- **Purpose**: Application bootstrap and dependency injection
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Load configuration from environment variables
  - Initialize GitHub and OPA clients
  - Wire up services with dependency injection
  - Start HTTP server on configured port

#### 2. Webhook Handler (`internal/handlers/`)
- **Purpose**: Process GitHub webhook events with modular, event-specific handlers
- **Architecture**: Refactored into specialized handlers with shared processing patterns for improved maintainability
- **Components**:
  - **WebhookRouter** (`webhook_router.go`): Main dispatcher that routes events to appropriate handlers

## Security Check Run System

Polly implements a **dual-track security validation system** where vulnerability and license checks operate independently but in parallel. For end-to-end flow diagrams, rerun processing, and artifact reuse see the consolidated [CHECK-RUN-SYSTEM.md](./CHECK-RUN-SYSTEM.md).

### Quick Overview
- **Two Check Types**: Vulnerability checks (Trivy reports) and License checks (SPDX SBOM)
- **Event-Driven**: Triggered by GitHub PR and workflow events
- **Concurrent Processing**: Parallel evaluation and completion of security checks
- **Policy-Based**: Uses OPA for configurable security policy enforcement

### Design Patterns Used

The current architecture leverages several design patterns for maintainability and extensibility:

#### 1. **Strategy Pattern**
- **Policy Evaluators**: `VulnerabilityEvaluator`, `SBOMEvaluator` implement `PolicyEvaluator` interface
- **Content Detectors**: `SPDXDetector`, `TrivyJSONDetector`, `SARIFDetector` implement `ContentDetector` interface
- **Policy Processors**: `VulnerabilityPolicyProcessor`, `LicensePolicyProcessor` for webhook-level processing
- **Benefits**: Easy addition of new policy types, content formats, and processing strategies

#### 2. **Factory/Registry Pattern**
- **Policy Service**: Maintains registry of evaluators by policy type for type-safe dispatch
- **Security Service**: Uses detector registry with priority-based selection
- **Benefits**: Loose coupling, extensible without code changes, clear separation of concerns

#### 3. **Dependency Injection**
- **Service Layer**: All services managed via service registry pattern in `internal/app/container.go` with clear dependency graph
- **Service Registry**: New services added through simple registration in `createServiceRegistrations()`
- **Type Safety**: All dependencies are concrete types with compile-time checking
- **Encapsulation**: Internal services are private, only handlers exported for external access
- **Testing**: Interface segregation enables easy mocking (e.g., `PolicyServiceInterface`)
- **Benefits**: Easy service addition, testable components, configurable implementations, clear dependencies

> **ðŸ“– For adding new services**, see [ADR-010: Container Service Registry Pattern](./ADR-010-container-service-registry-pattern.md)

#### 4. **Helper Function Architecture**
- **Large Functions Extracted**: Complex data transformation moved to `helpers.go` for reusability
- **Single Responsibility**: Each helper focuses on specific data transformation tasks
- **Benefits**: Improved maintainability, reduced code duplication, easier testing

#### 5. **Type Safety Throughout**
- **Strongly Typed Payloads**: All policy inputs/outputs use concrete types
- **Generic Functions**: `evaluatePolicy[T, R]()` provides type-safe OPA interaction
- **Interface Definitions**: Clear contracts between components
- **Benefits**: Compile-time safety, better IDE support, reduced runtime errors

## Data Flow Patterns

### 1. Security Check Run Processing
```
GitHub PR opened/reopened
    â†“
handlers.WebhookRouter.HandleWebhook() â†’ PullRequestHandler.HandlePullRequestEvent()
    â†“
services.StateService.StorePRNumber(owner, repo, sha, prNumber) - Store SHA â†’ PR number mapping
    â†“
SecurityCheckManager.CreateSecurityCheckRuns() - Create Vulnerability + License Check Runs (Concurrent)
    â†“
services.StateService.StoreVulnCheckRunID(owner, repo, sha, ID) + StoreLicenseCheckRunID(owner, repo, sha, ID)
    â†“
GitHub Workflow completed
    â†“
handlers.WebhookRouter.HandleWebhook() â†’ WorkflowHandler.HandleWorkflowRunEvent()
    â†“
services.StateService.GetPRNumber(owner, repo, sha) - Retrieve PR context by repository
    â†“
services.SecurityService.ProcessWorkflowSecurityArtifacts()
    â†“
helpers.processVulnerabilityChecks() + processLicenseChecks() (Concurrent via WorkflowHandler.processSecurityPayloads())
    â†“
services.PolicyService.CheckVulnerabilityPolicy() + CheckSBOMPolicy()
    â†“
clients.OPAClient.EvaluatePolicy()
    â†“
services.CheckService.CompletePolicyCheck()
    â†“
clients.GitHubClient.UpdateCheckRun()
```

### Event deduplication policy

To avoid duplicate check runs for the same commit, Polly follows these rules:
- Check runs are created primarily in `pull_request` handling (opened/reopened/synchronize).
- On `workflow_run` start (requested/in_progress), if check IDs exist in `StateService`, Polly sets them to `in_progress` and does not create new checks. Artifact processing occurs on `completed`.
- `check_suite` events never create check runs; they coordinate reruns using stored check IDs and delegate to existing rerun logic.

### 2. Check Run Re-request Processing
```
GitHub check run re-requested
    â†“
handlers.WebhookRouter.HandleWebhook() â†’ CheckRunHandler.HandleCheckRunEvent()
    â†“
services.StateService.GetPRNumber(owner, repo, sha) - Retrieve PR context
    â†“
services.StateService.GetWorkflowRunID(owner, repo, sha) - Find associated workflow
    â†“
CheckRunHandler.restartVulnerabilityCheck() or restartLicenseCheck()
    â†“
helpers.processVulnerabilityChecks() or processLicenseChecks()
    â†“
Re-process workflow artifacts and complete check run
```

### 3. Generic Event Information Extraction
```go
// Type-safe event handling with generics
func getEventInfo[T github.PullRequestPayload | github.CheckRunPayload](event T) (owner, repo, sha string, id int64)
```

## Key Design Patterns

### 1. Generic Policy Evaluation
```go
// Type-safe policy evaluation with compile-time guarantees
func evaluatePolicy[T any, R any](ctx context.Context, service *PolicyService, policyPath string, input T) (R, error)
```
- **Benefits**: Type safety, compile-time checking, flexible policy support
- **Usage**: `result, err := evaluatePolicy[HelloInput, bool](ctx, service, "/v1/data/playground/hello", input)`

### 2. Modular Handler Architecture
- **Pattern**: Event-specific handlers with shared base functionality
- **Implementation**: `BaseWebhookHandler` provides common dependencies, specialized handlers for each event type
- **Benefits**: Clear separation of concerns, easier testing, reduced code duplication
- **Usage**: `PullRequestHandler`, `CheckRunHandler`, `WorkflowHandler` all extend base functionality

### 3. Centralized Telemetry Pattern
- **Pattern**: Consistent OpenTelemetry tracing across all operations
- **Implementation**: `TelemetryHelper` provides standardized span creation & error attribution
- **Benefits**: Eliminates boilerplate, consistent observability, easy to extend, standardized error attributes
- **Usage**: `ctx, span := telemetry.StartSpan(ctx, "operation.name")`; on errors call `telemetry.SetErrorAttribute(span, err)`

### 4. Shared Processing Functions
- **Pattern**: Common business logic extracted into reusable functions with standardized types
- **Implementation**:
  - **Types**: `PolicyProcessingResult` for policy evaluation results, `WebhookProcessingConfig` for common parameters
  - **Functions**: `processVulnerabilityPolicies()`, `processLicensePolicies()`, `postVulnerabilityComments()`, `postLicenseComments()`
  - **Builders**: `buildVulnerabilityCheckResult()`, `buildLicenseCheckResult()` for standardized check run results
- **Benefits**: DRY principle, consistent behavior, single point of maintenance, function length compliance (all functions <80 lines)
- **Usage**: Used by workflow completion, check run rerun handlers, and artifact processing methods

### 5. Policy Processing Standardization
- **Pattern**: Unified approach to policy evaluation across vulnerability and license checks
- **Implementation**:
  ```go
  type PolicyProcessingResult struct {
      AllPassed           bool
      Violations          []VulnerabilityPolicyVuln
      ConditionalComponents []SBOMPolicyComponent
      Summary             string
      Details             string
  }

  func processVulnerabilityPolicies(ctx context.Context, ...) (*PolicyProcessingResult, error)
  func processLicensePolicies(ctx context.Context, ...) (*PolicyProcessingResult, error)
  ```
- **Benefits**: Type safety, consistent error handling, reusable across different event types
- **Usage**: Eliminates code duplication between workflow and check run handlers

### 6. Dependency Injection Pattern
- **Service Registry**: Services registered via `createServiceRegistrations()` for easy addition
- **Constructor Pattern**: Services receive dependencies through constructors (`NewXxxService`)
- **Private Encapsulation**: Internal services are private fields with controlled access
- **Clear dependency graph**: Handlers â†’ Services â†’ Clients
- **Easy testing**: Interface mocking supported with concrete type safety
- **Configuration injected**: All dependencies wired at startup through registry

### 6. Event-Driven Processing
- Webhook events trigger policy evaluations
- Asynchronous check run updates
- Support for re-running failed checks
- Stateless processing for horizontal scaling

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Go Generics for Type Safety
- **Benefit**: Compile-time type checking for policy evaluation
- **Trade-off**: Requires Go 1.18+ and more complex syntax
- **Rationale**: Eliminates runtime type assertions and improves API safety

### 2. Environment-Based Configuration
- **Benefit**: 12-factor app compliance, container-friendly
- **Trade-off**: Runtime configuration only
- **Rationale**: Cloud-native deployment and GitOps workflows

### 4. Modular Webhook Handler Architecture
- **Benefit**: Clear separation of concerns, improved maintainability, easier testing
- **Trade-off**: More files to manage, slightly more complex initialization
- **Rationale**: Original monolithic handler (1017 lines) was difficult to maintain and test

### 5. Centralized Utility Functions
- **Benefit**: Eliminates code duplication, consistent patterns, easier maintenance
- **Trade-off**: Requires coordination when changing shared functions
- **Rationale**: Repeated tracing and processing logic across multiple handlers
- **Rationale**: DRY principle and consistent event processing

### 4. Policy Service Abstraction
- **Benefit**: Supports any OPA policy bundle without code changes
- **Trade-off**: Less type safety for unknown policies
- **Rationale**: Extensibility for user-defined policies

### 5. Structured Logging with Context
- **Benefit**: Rich debugging information and request tracing
- **Trade-off**: More verbose code
- **Rationale**: Production observability requirements

## Policy Integration

### OPA Communication Pattern
```
Input: {"input": {"message": "hello"}}
Policy Path: /v1/data/playground/hello
Output: {"result": true}
```

### Policy Bundle Structure
```
playground/
â”œâ”€â”€ hello          # Simple message validation
â”œâ”€â”€ allow          # Authorization rules
â”œâ”€â”€ greeting       # Dynamic response generation
â””â”€â”€ user_permissions # Role-based access control
```

### Adding New Policies
1. Deploy OPA bundle to server
2. Call `policyService.EvaluatePolicy(ctx, "/v1/data/bundle/rule", input)`
3. Handle typed response based on policy output

No code changes required for new policy bundles.
## Future Considerations

- Dashboard for policy success rates
- Alerting on policy evaluation failures

### Enhanced Features
- Support for additional GitHub events (pushes, releases)
- Multi-step policy workflows
- Custom policy result formatting
- Integration with other policy engines

## Vulnerability Check System

The vulnerability check system processes security artifacts from GitHub Actions workflows and evaluates them against OPA policies. This system runs parallel to policy checks and provides automated security review for pull requests.

### Vulnerability Check Flow

```
GitHub Workflow Event â†’ Security Artifact Discovery â†’ Payload Normalization â†’ OPA Policy Evaluation â†’ Check Run Update & PR Comments
```

### Key Components

#### 1. Security Service (`internal/services/security.go`)
- **Purpose**: Discover, download, and normalize security artifacts from GitHub workflows
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Download artifacts from completed GitHub Actions workflows
  - Detect security report formats (Trivy JSON, SARIF, SPDX SBOM)
  - Normalize different formats into unified `VulnerabilityPayload` structure
  - Extract vulnerability metadata, CVSS scores, and package information

#### 2. Vulnerability Check Orchestration (`internal/handlers/webhook.go`)
- **Purpose**: Coordinate the vulnerability scanning workflow
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Create pending vulnerability check runs when workflows start
  - Process completed workflows to extract security artifacts
  - Coordinate OPA policy evaluation for vulnerability data
  - Post PR comments with policy violation details
  - Complete check runs with appropriate success/failure status

#### 3. Vulnerability Policy Evaluation (`internal/services/policy.go`)
- **Purpose**: Evaluate complete vulnerability payloads against OPA policies
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Send full `VulnerabilityPayload` to OPA vulnerability policies
  - Process policy results to determine compliance status
  - Extract non-compliant vulnerabilities for user feedback

### Workflow Lifecycle

#### Phase 1: Workflow Start Detection
```go
// When GitHub workflow starts (action: "requested" or "in_progress")
handleWorkflowStarted() {
    1. Check if SHA has associated PR context
    2. Create pending vulnerability check run
    3. Store check run ID for later completion
}
```

#### Phase 2: Workflow Completion Processing
```go
// When GitHub workflow completes (action: "completed")
handleWorkflowCompleted() {
    1. Check workflow conclusion (only process "success")
    2. Download and inspect workflow artifacts
    3. Discover security reports (Trivy, SARIF, SBOM)
    4. Normalize artifacts into VulnerabilityPayload structures
    5. Evaluate payloads against OPA vulnerability policies
    6. Post PR comments for policy violations
    7. Complete vulnerability check run with final status
}
```

### Vulnerability Payload Structure

The system normalizes all security artifacts into a unified `VulnerabilityPayload`:

```go
type VulnerabilityPayload struct {
    Type            string                   // "vulnerability_json", "vulnerability_sarif", etc.
    Metadata        PayloadMetadata          // Scan context and tool information
    Vulnerabilities []Vulnerability          // Normalized vulnerability data
    Summary         VulnerabilitySummary     // Aggregated statistics
}

type PayloadMetadata struct {
    SourceFormat  string  // "trivy", "sarif", "spdx"
    ToolName      string  // "trivy", "snyk", "github-security-advisories"
    ToolVersion   string  // Tool version for compatibility
    ScanTime      string  // ISO timestamp of scan
    Repository    string  // "owner/repo"
    CommitSHA     string  // Git commit being scanned
    PRNumber      int     // Associated PR number
    ScanTarget    string  // File being scanned (package.json, Dockerfile)
    SchemaVersion string  // Payload schema version
}
```

### OPA Policy Integration

#### Full Context Policy Evaluation
The system passes complete vulnerability payloads to OPA policies, providing rich context:

```json
{
  "input": {
    "type": "vulnerability_json",
    "metadata": {
      "source_format": "trivy",
      "tool_name": "trivy",
      "tool_version": "0.50.0",
      "scan_time": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "repository": "owner/repo",
      "commit_sha": "abc123def456",
      "pr_number": 42,
      "scan_target": "package.json",
      "schema_version": "1.0"
    },
    "vulnerabilities": [
      {
        "id": "CVE-2021-3749",
        "severity": "CRITICAL",
        "score": 9.8,
        "package": {
          "name": "axios",
          "version": "0.21.1",
          "ecosystem": "npm"
        },
        "location": {
          "file": "package.json",
          "line": 15
        },
        "description": "Axios is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery",
        "fixed_version": "0.21.2",
        "references": ["https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3749"]
      }
    ],
    "summary": {
      "total_vulnerabilities": 49,
      "critical": 2,
      "high": 22,
      "medium": 20,
      "low": 5,
      "info": 0
    }
  }
}
```

#### Policy Response Structure
OPA policies return structured results indicating compliance:

```json
{
  "result": {
    "compliant": false,
    "compliant_count": 25,
    "non_compliant_count": 24,
    "non_compliant_vulnerabilities": [
      {
        "id": "CVE-2021-3749",
        "package": "axios",
        "version": "0.21.1",
        "severity": "CRITICAL",
        "score": 9.8
      }
    ],
    "total_vulnerabilities": 49
  }
}
```

### Advanced Policy Capabilities

#### Context-Aware Decision Making
OPA policies can make sophisticated decisions based on:

- **Scan Target Context**: Different rules for `package.json` vs `Dockerfile` vs `requirements.txt`
- **Repository Context**: Per-repo or org-specific policy overrides
- **Tool Compatibility**: Version-specific behavior for different scanning tools
- **PR Context**: Different approval workflows for different types of changes
- **Temporal Context**: Time-based policies (emergency patches, maintenance windows)

#### Example Policy Logic
```rego
# Block critical vulnerabilities in production dependencies
allow = false {
    input.metadata.scan_target == "package.json"
    input.vulnerabilities[_].severity == "CRITICAL"
    input.vulnerabilities[_].package.ecosystem == "npm"
}

# Allow specific CVEs that have been manually reviewed
allow = true {
    input.vulnerabilities[_].id in data.approved_cves
}

# Different rules for different repositories
allow = true {
    input.metadata.repository == "owner/internal-tool"
    input.summary.critical == 0
    input.summary.high <= 5
}
```

### Security Artifact Support

#### Supported Formats
1. **Trivy JSON**: Complete vulnerability reports with CVSS scores and fix information
2. **SARIF**: Static analysis results interchange format for broader tool compatibility
3. **SPDX SBOM**: Software bill of materials for license and dependency analysis

#### Artifact Discovery
```go
// Automatic detection of security content in workflow artifacts
detectSecurityContent(content []byte, filename string) ArtifactType {
    // 1. Try SPDX JSON detection (document structure)
    // 2. Try Trivy JSON detection (vulnerability schema)
    // 3. Try SARIF detection (static analysis schema)
    // 4. Return unknown if no match
}
```

### Error Handling and Fallbacks

#### Graceful Degradation
- If OPA policy evaluation fails, falls back to simple severity-based rules
- If no artifacts found, completes check as "neutral" with informative message
- If workflow fails, marks vulnerability check as "skipped"

#### User Feedback
- **Expandable PR Comments**: Summary with collapsible details to avoid overwhelming conversations
- **Rich Check Run Details**: Complete vulnerability information in GitHub check runs
- **Policy Violation Context**: Clear explanations of why specific vulnerabilities were blocked

### Performance Considerations

#### Efficient Processing
- Streams large artifact downloads to avoid memory issues
- Concurrent artifact processing for multiple security reports
- Caches vulnerability data to avoid redundant OPA evaluations

#### Scalability
- In-memory PR context storage with planned ValKey migration
- Stateless processing for horizontal scaling
- Background artifact processing to avoid blocking webhook responses

### Future Enhancements

#### Planned Features
- **Multiple Security Tools**: Support for Snyk, GitHub Security Advisories, etc.
- **Historical Tracking**: Vulnerability trend analysis across commits
- **Auto-Fix Suggestions**: Integration with dependency update tools
- **Risk Scoring**: Composite scores based on multiple factors
- **Compliance Reporting**: Generate reports for security audits

#### Extensibility
- Plugin architecture for new security tool integrations
- Custom payload transformation rules
- Webhook integrations for external security platforms
- API endpoints for external vulnerability data sources
