# Policy Cache Implementation - Summary

## Implementation Overview

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive policy caching solution for the Polly application that respects the configuration settings and maintains clean architecture patterns.

## Key Components

### 1. PolicyCacheService (`internal/services/policy_cache.go`)

A new service layer that wraps the core PolicyService and adds caching functionality:

- **CheckVulnerabilityPolicyWithCache()**: Cached vulnerability policy evaluation
- **CheckSBOMPolicyWithCache()**: Cached SBOM policy evaluation
- Configuration-aware caching (only caches when `config.AppConfig.Storage.PolicyCache.Enabled` is true)
- Uses repository context (owner, repo, sha) as cache keys
- Implements proper OpenTelemetry tracing with cache hit/miss tracking

### 2. Clean Architecture Restoration

**PolicyService** (`internal/services/policy.go`):
- Reverted to clean architecture with only OPAClient and Logger dependencies
- Pure policy evaluation without coupling to StateService
- Single responsibility principle maintained

**Container** (`internal/app/container.go`):
- Added PolicyCacheService to dependency injection
- Proper separation of concerns between PolicyService and PolicyCacheService

### 3. Handler-Level Integration

**BaseWebhookHandler** (`internal/handlers/helpers.go`):
- Added PolicyCacheService as a dependency alongside existing PolicyService
- Both services available for different use cases

**Policy Processors** (`internal/handlers/policy_processing.go`):
- Updated strategy pattern to use PolicyCacheServiceInterface
- ProcessPayloads methods now use cached policy evaluation
- Configuration-aware caching built into the workflow

### 4. Configuration Integration

The cache respects the existing configuration:
```go
if config.AppConfig.Storage.PolicyCache.Enabled {
    // Cache operations only happen when enabled
}
```

## Cache Flow

1. **Cache Check**: When a policy evaluation is requested, first check if cached results exist
2. **Cache Miss**: If no cache hit, evaluate policy using the core PolicyService
3. **Cache Store**: Store the policy results (not raw artifacts) with TTL
4. **Cache Hit**: Return cached results with telemetry marking

## Benefits

### 1. Performance
- Eliminates redundant OPA policy evaluations for the same commit
- Significant performance improvement for GitHub re-runs
- Maintains existing functionality while adding caching layer

### 2. Clean Architecture
- PolicyService remains pure and focused on policy evaluation
- Caching is a separate concern handled by PolicyCacheService
- No coupling violations between services

### 3. Configuration Respect
- Cache behavior controlled by existing config settings
- Can be disabled/enabled without code changes
- Follows established configuration patterns

### 4. Observability
- OpenTelemetry tracing for cache operations
- Cache hit/miss metrics available
- Proper logging for debugging

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Wrapper Service Pattern
Instead of modifying PolicyService directly, we created PolicyCacheService as a wrapper. This:
- Preserves clean architecture
- Allows both cached and non-cached usage
- Maintains backwards compatibility

### 2. Handler-Level Caching
Cache logic is implemented at the handler level where repository context naturally exists:
- Handlers have access to owner/repo/sha for cache keys
- Avoids passing repository context through service layers
- Maintains proper separation of concerns

### 3. PolicyResult Caching
We cache the processed PolicyResults rather than raw artifacts:
- More efficient storage
- Cached data matches actual usage patterns
- Avoids re-processing cached artifacts

## Testing

All tests have been updated to work with the new architecture:
- Services tests verify core policy evaluation functionality
- Handlers tests use MockPolicyCacheService for testing cached behavior
- Integration tests ensure proper dependency injection
- All existing functionality preserved

## Configuration

The cache uses existing configuration structure:
```yaml
storage:
  policy_cache:
    enabled: true
    ttl: "1h"
    max_size: 1000
```

## Usage

The cache is transparent to existing code. Handlers automatically use cached policy evaluation when:
1. PolicyCacheService is available (via dependency injection)
2. Configuration enables caching
3. Repository context is available (owner/repo/sha)

## Files Modified

- `internal/services/policy_cache.go` - New cache service
- `internal/services/policy.go` - Reverted to clean architecture
- `internal/app/container.go` - Added cache service to DI
- `internal/handlers/helpers.go` - Added cache service to handlers
- `internal/handlers/policy_processing.go` - Updated strategy pattern
- `internal/handlers/check_processors.go` - Updated to use cache service
- `internal/handlers/webhook_router.go` - Updated constructor
- Various test files - Updated for new architecture

## Future Enhancements

1. **Cache Metrics**: Add detailed cache hit/miss metrics
2. **Cache Warming**: Pre-populate cache for common scenarios
3. **Advanced TTL**: Dynamic TTL based on artifact type
4. **Cache Eviction**: LRU or other intelligent eviction strategies

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully adds policy caching while:
- Maintaining clean architecture principles
- Respecting configuration settings
- Preserving all existing functionality
- Adding proper observability and testing
- Following established patterns in the codebase
